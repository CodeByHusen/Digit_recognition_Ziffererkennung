# Introduction
This is a Project that uses a neural network to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. In order to run the program, the user must download the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist).

The MINST dataset problem is one of the most well-known problems in the field of machine learning and is often used as an entry point for students or beginners in the field. It is a classification problem that involves identifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9 based on image data.

The MINST dataset problem presents a challenge because the digits can be written differently and there are many variables that need to be taken into account. It requires a deep understanding of concepts such as neural networks and deep learning in order to find a solution to the problem.

Despite its simplicity, the MINST dataset problem has a great significance for the development of technologies such as automatic text recognition and image processing. It has contributed to the establishment of machine learning as an important subfield of artificial intelligence and is a key milestone in the development of technologies capable of solving complex problems.
